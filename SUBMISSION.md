## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Serverless & Event-Driven
```
User Query → Bedrock Agent Core → Action Groups:
                                   ├─ Athena (metrics)
                                   ├─ SageMaker (forecasts)
                                   └─ Nova (creative)

Autonomous: EventBridge → Lambda → Agent Workflow
```

### Data Pipeline
```
Multiple Marketplaces → S3 Landing → Glue ETL → S3 Curated
                                                    ↓
                                    Athena ← → SageMaker ← → Agent
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Marketplace Adapters** - Plugin architecture for new platforms
2. **Unified Schema** - Normalize data from all sources
3. **Bedrock Agent Core** - Native AWS orchestration
4. **Infrastructure as Code** - Fully reproducible with CDK
