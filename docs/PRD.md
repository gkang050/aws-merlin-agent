# MERLIN
*Marketplace Earnings & Revenue Learning Intelligence Network*

## Vision Statement
> "To democratize intelligent growth for every e-commerce marketplace seller by unifying advertising, pricing, and inventory insights into an intelligent, autonomous growth-based agentic AI system."

## Core Vision
MERLIN is a marketplace-agnostic AI growth agent built on AWS's GenAI stack (Nova, Bedrock, SageMaker, Agent Core). It empowers sellers across multiple platforms through a unified intelligence layer that automates manual decisions while keeping humans in control.

### How MERLIN Unifies the E-Commerce Ecosystem

- Provides unified analytics across all selling channels
- Surfaces insights to improve campaign effectiveness and seller engagement

MERLIN's mission is to empower businesses of all sizes to succeed across any marketplace—*smarter sellers → better listings → improved customer experience → increased conversions → higher engagement → sustainable growth*.

## Market Context
